# Description
My most recent in-progress Python project. Also the one with the widest possible scope. The idea for this project comes from an intersection of multiple educational experiences: Learning to use an oscilloscope in Physics 3L, learning to compose counterpoint in MUS 5A, learning experimental electronic music composition methodologies in MUS 8 and 108, mathematical music videos on Youtube (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhUcHtbDOWE&ab_channel=LucidRhythms) and of course my programming classes. The final product should be a development environment and UI for these types of videos. Users should be able to drop phsyical objects into a 2D plane that produce tones upon collision with specified objects or from other triggers. This will allow for easy creation of experimental and mathematical soundscapes.

# To run
Run bounce.py with pygame installed.

# Current Version: 1.2
Plays mostly total chaos. Every run of the program is randomized. Everything is now here to produce the type of video in the description, but the problem is currently that it is not modifiable except by changing the source code. Instead, users should have a "level editor" function where they can manually OR randomly add the colored balls into the arena. Advanced functionality could be to change how balls are spawned during playback and could be to change how balls collide/anything else?
# Next Version: 2.0
Add "level editor" functionality.

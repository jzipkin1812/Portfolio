# Description
I love ASCII games! Here are those I have invented. The best one is Mansion.c, which you will need to compile yourself with gcc. I normally do not do ASCII games (or games at all) in C, but this was a good exercise and the product is quite fun and challenging. Other notes:

Upgrade Wars is unfinished. I want to come back to it because I have a ton of ideas written down for it but it is really low on my priority list.
Dungeon Crawler is really fun but quite old. Perhaps the oldest project in this entire repository. Code is ugly. The difficulty is also no joke.
Egg Drop is a coded response to a TedED riddle. I couldn't solve the riddle, but I could code it. Is that just as good? You decide.

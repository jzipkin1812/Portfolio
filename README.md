# Portfolio
Software I have created over the years. Most of it is video games, but there is a lot of variety. Each individual folder has a README description. You should check out "Raise the Bar," "Musescratch," and "Combomoji Brawl" first if you want to see my largest/most recent projects. Combomoji Brawl was my first full game and is a bit old so it does not reflect my current organization skills. All of the projects in this folder were individual by me. See my lab1DSITJZ repo for a large group project.

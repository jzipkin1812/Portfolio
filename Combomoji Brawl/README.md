#Description
This was my first 'real' Python project back in high school. It is a 2D fighting game made for a close friend for her birthday, featuring characters and inside jokes from our lives at the time. It is ridiculous, nonsensical, and coded with much less organization and optimization than I would code projects nowadays, but nonetheless, I am proud of this achievement and it took me many hours.

# Description
My most recent in-progress Python project. Also the one with the widest possible scope. The idea for this project comes from an intersection of multiple educational experiences: Learning to use an oscilloscope in Physics 3L, learning to compose counterpoint in MUS 5A, learning experimental electronic music composition methodologies in MUS 8 and 108, mathematical music videos on Youtube (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhUcHtbDOWE&ab_channel=LucidRhythms) and of course my programming classes. The final product should be a development environment and UI for these types of videos. Users should be able to drop phsyical objects into a 2D plane that produce tones upon collision with specified objects or from other triggers. This will allow for easy creation of experimental and mathematical soundscapes.

#To run
Run bounce.py with pygame installed.

#Current Version: 1.0
Plays a Bach-style counterpoint melody with sine tones. 

#Next Version: 1.1
Should improve tone quality. Should optimize sound creation.

*Glitches* H-h-hey everyone. It's me, Betty Cooper. More      
specifically, Glitch Betty. Welcome to Riverfail's bar studio.
Today we'll be doing a full Bar Method class. You'll learn all
the fundamentals you need for a hotter body. *sexy glitch*
If you fuck up, that's alright! It's just a Betty Glitch!
Except if Noreen is watching. Then, we'll just execute you.
But I'm not worried. I have the Warrior Gene. (and the
Serial Killer Gene but that's beside the point)
During today's class we'll use the Bar Ball as well as the
Slider. That's right, a new prop! I wonder what it does?
But no more delays. Time for your warm-up! *glitches*

Let's make the music a bit faster than our Express class
for some extra challenge. Down, up, down, up, down, up...
Now, approach the bar and grab your slider. This'll be a bit
tricky, so pay attention. 
When an arrow passes over a slider, that arrow will flip its
direction 180 degrees. You'll have to press a different key.
Try to keep up as the arrows turn around. Now slide left, dip
down, center. Feel the burn in your thighs. Nice job!
Can you take the heat? Or will you *glitch* get all mixed up?

Let's crank that AC for you.

Now hold. Pulse, pulse, pulse. Pulse, pulse, pulse.
You're doing *BIGASS GLITCH* amazing!
Whew! Take a minute to stretch; you've earned it. I'm sure you 
did flawlessly with those sliders. They're quite easy to use.
Oh, what's that? I glitched out and accidentally broke the
A.C.? What's that? The room is 105 degrees right now?
Oh god. I might be glitching out. Oh jesus christ. Once I start I
can't stop. It's 'cause Mercury is in retrograde, you guys.
Oh my god! I just knocked over the bin of Bar Balls! Clean that
up for me, won't you?
SHIT SHIT SHIT. NOREEN IS WALKING BY THE DOOR. GUYS. GUYS. 
PRETEND THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE. DO, UM...PUSH UPS OR SOMETHING.
Oh heyyyyyyy Noreen! Yeah, we're doing...Oh, the heat?
Yup, it's...Bar Hot. Hot Bar. You know? Like Hot Yoga, but Bar?
Oh, Lana? That bitc- um, that wonderful coworker of mine?
No, I haven't seen her. *Tries to hide a glitch*
She's supposed to teach Bar Celibacy at 12:15 and then Bar 
Relationship Workshop (Livestream) at 4:30. Ask Gerri?
Ok...bye! *one of the mirrors cracks*

...

GUYS DID SHE NOTICE? WAS THAT BAD? Oh, you guys are still doing 
push ups! ...Great! I guess I never told you to stop!
You know, she's always on my ass about nothing but she LOVES
that bitchy cone. I hate her. 
Ugh. Whatever. We're almost done anyway. I don't care. Whatever.

I think I need to get off Prozac. I mean, um, time for back
dancing.
Oh my God Noreen just texted me and told me I'm doing the 630AM
Flow class tomorrow. Fuuuuuuck meeeeee. 
Alright you guys, you're done. Time for cool down. Yes, Kelly,
I know the A.C. is still broken. Thanks. For that note.
Deep breath in...deep breath out. Give yourselves a round of
applause! You did amazing! Or not. I mostly wasn't watching.
Here's the possible points:

Bye, ladies! *Sexy glitch*

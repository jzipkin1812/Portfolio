#Description
This is my most recently completed and, in my opinion, most well-organized project in Python. It was a gift for my mom for Mothers' Day. She loves the Bar Method workout classes (as do I, you should check it out!) so this is a game based on those plus plenty of family inside jokes. Be warned: Not for children. Profanity present. I have chill parents.

#How to run
Go to src/raise.py and run it. Again, you need Pygame installed.

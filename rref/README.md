# Description
Over the years I have written many programs to help me with my math homework. Don't worry, I didn't cheat, but I did use this to check my work once I had done it by hand. This program uses the contents of rref.txt and converts it to reduced row echelon form using Gaussian elimination. There are no external matrix libraries used; all algorithms/matrix row operations are my own design. Was creating this entire program more trouble than it was worth? Of course! But I learned a lot.
# To run
Edit the text file in the format shown. Entries separated by spaces. Make sure each row has the same number of columns. 
make rref
./rref

Welcome to Bar Strength! My name is Gerri, and you might be
wondering why I'm teaching a Bar class. Well...
As soon as Logan said "NO GERRI" I was essentially toast. I got
booted from Waystar and, well, this is my new gig. Don't judge.
Oh, Shiv! Hey, girl! Is this your first class? It's so great to
see you! 
You have such a healthy glow! ... No, Shiv, I don't mean it. You 
look  like shit. How's the baby, by the way?
Wait, WHAT?! Tom got full custody in the divorce? You haven't
seen your child in years? All you do is drink and watch Hulu?
That's...

That's...

AMAZING! Girl you hit the JACKPOT! Ooh, girl, I gotta get
whatever lawyer you got. Oh. Wait. I AM a lawyer. Sweet!
Now who's ready to get FIT today?!

That's right, ladies, you might think of me as an old fart from
the fuck factory, but this new job has me feeling a lot different.
You're see God today, ladies. Now get your
butt up off of that damn floor and LIFT THOSE LEGS! YES!
LIFT! LIFT! LIFT! HARDER, DAMNIT! THIS IS BAR STRENGTH, NOT 
BAR "I'M GONNA HALF-ASS THIS LIKE I HALF-ASS MY MARRIAGE"!
Right into double-reverse-triple-ultra push ups.
Ooooh girl, I love this part in the music. Uh. Uh. Get into it.
Yup. The sliders are back. 'Cuz why not. --Um, yes, Shiv, I CAN
just make up exercises. I CAN just "do" that. This is MY class.
Option to go on releve. Heh. Heh. Heh. I knew no one was gonna be 
able to do that. That's why I said it. 
Shiv, shoulders back. Lift your gaze. Oh, don't give me that
stank face! I'm doing my job! Unlike you at that board meeting.
Alright, time to go to the bar and grab your ball for something
I like to call "double decker arabesque." Don't. Even. Ask.
Shiv, not half-bad! Although I have to say I don't love your
workout clothes. A brown turtleneck and a Green Day tee? Really?
I don't know what this next thing is called, but I know you can't 
do it with a stick up your ass. Shiv, you'll need to modify.
Asha, Roxy, stunning form. Incredible. Roxy, amazing leap.

I hear we have a birthday in the class today! Happy birthday,
Cori! As a birthday present, this next exercise will be easy.
Well, wasn't that nice. Makes me feel like I'm back on that
bigass boat. Anyway, back to our regularly scheduled pain.
Did you know they had a bar studio at our New York office? They
never showed it in the actual show, but I was there all the time.
It's why I never wanted the top job. All along, I had this secret
dream of mine: Gerri Kelman, Bar Instructor Extraordinaire!
Can you tell me and Noreen get along really well?

Maybe that one was too much. Ava just fainted. Although...
Shiv, you look great after doing that. Pros and cons. 
My favorite bar studio is probably in Sarajevo, or, or Argentina,
or Bosnia, or, the Czech Republic, LA, or New York. 
Okay, this shit is about to get plain stupid. Glitch Betty, can
you do me a favor? Make those little arrows go way too FAST.
That was fun! Ow, my arthritis.

Hey, you know what my divorce lawyer said when I married my
fourth husband? "This is your second-to-last-thing." Ha!
You're done! Amazing! Aaaand....Shiv is out the door. That snake
could apparently NOT stay for cool-down. Figures.
Take the strap by your right. This'll be a nice stretch.

Now, deep breath in...and out. Deep breath in...and out. Lovely!
Give yourselves a big round of applause for our hardest class!
Here's the possible points:

Here's your final rank:
And remember, if you want an easy class: NO GERRI!

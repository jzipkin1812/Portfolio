#Description
This is a much smaller project included just for fun. It simulates a popular TikTok trend from around 2020 where the user opens a "mystery egg" (a la Kinder) with various versions of a specific character or celebrity inside. In this case, it is Trisha Paytas themed. I was frustrated that the trend on Tiktok was uninteractive with the user and non-repeatable, so I coded it myself! 
#How to play
Just click on the egg 3 times. Every time you do it you'll get something a bit different.
